This repo contains the code and analysis for a collaborative project that emerged from [PACE Hackweek](https://pacehackweek.github.io/pace-2024/intro.html). Here we streamed both PACE and MODIS remote sensing products to explore relationships between aerosol and surface ocean properties in the Gulf of Mexico before, during, and following the 2024 Central American fires.
